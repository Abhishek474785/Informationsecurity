Network security is a broad term that covers a multitude of technologies, 
devices and processes. In its simplest term, it is a set of rules and 
configurations designed to protect the integrity, confidentiality and 
accessibility of computer networks and data using both software and 
hardware technologies. Every organization, regardless of size, industry 
or infrastructure, requires a degree of network security solutions in
 place to protect it from the ever-growing landscape of cyber threats 
in the wild today.
